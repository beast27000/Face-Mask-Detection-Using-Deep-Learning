# Face-Mask-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
This project trains a deep learning model using 8,000 images (4,000 with masks, 4,000 without) to detect face masks in real-time. It leverages TensorFlow, OpenCV, and other tools for accurate classification, making it ideal for public health applications like compliance monitoring in public spaces.

### Project Summary

**Title:** Face Mask Detection Using Deep Learning

This project involves training a deep learning model to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. The training dataset consists of two folders containing approximately 4,000 images each: one for individuals wearing masks and another for those not wearing masks. The system is designed for real-time detection and classification, making it suitable for public health applications, such as monitoring compliance in public spaces.

**Key Features:**

- Trained on a dataset of 8,000 images (4,000 with masks, 4,000 without masks).
- Real-time detection and classification of individuals as "masked" or "unmasked."
- Leverages advanced deep learning techniques for high accuracy.
- Compatible with surveillance systems and mobile applications.
