# Face-Mask-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
This project trains a deep learning model using 8,000 images (4,000 with masks, 4,000 without) to detect face masks in real-time. It leverages TensorFlow, OpenCV, and other tools for accurate classification, making it ideal for public health applications like compliance monitoring in public spaces.
